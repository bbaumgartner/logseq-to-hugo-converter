Some people buy a yacht and set sail without any clue. You can do that, and there's nothing wrong with it, but we are too uptight for that. We want to do it "right." Moreover, we plan to charter various yachts before buying one, to figure out what works for us. And when you charter, you need proof that you know what you're doing. Otherwise, understandably, they won't give you a yacht.

So, what you need is a motorboat license (these yachts all have engines), a coastal sailing certificate (Day Skipper), and a radio license. There's this rumor that it's a huge deal, starting with years of experience on inland waters, then 1000 nautical miles proof and an ocean-going license and all that nonsense. That's not the case at all. As a Swiss, you don't need to get a Swiss license either. That's complete nonsense.

We were at the Boot Düsseldorf at Sönke's bluewater seminar and got informed. There are essentially two Day Skipper certificates: one from RYA and one from ASA. RYA from the English Royal Yachting Association and ASA from the American Sailing Association.

The JoJo Sailing School from Munich also had a booth at Boot Düsseldorf and they convinced us right away. However, they offer the German version from the German Sailing Association: SBF See, the motorboat license for sea, and the SKS, the coastal skipper certificate for sailing along the coast. These certificates are well-regarded and very well-known in Europe. So, we're trying that.

The practical part of the SBF was a breeze, to say the least, ridiculous. But we don't really want to drive motorboats anyway. The theory, however, was not bad, we learned a lot and you definitely need to practice. Especially the chart tasks are challenging.

With the SKS, the fun definitely ends. Here, the practice becomes elaborate and the theory challenging. For the practical part, we go to Portorož, Slovenia, where we sail one of the JoJo school ships for a week. We practice maneuvers and theory for several hours every day. It's drilled like in the military. We pass the exam on the last day without any problems. At least I do; Alexandra unfortunately gets sick during the week, can't practice, and therefore doesn't even take the exam.

I also pass the theory exam just before Christmas. It was really not easy and I had to study hard. I got ambitious and at least found the navigation tasks exciting. It's a different story for Alex: traumatic memories from math class resurface and she quits the practice. Honestly, the whole thing isn't really productive. The theory seems outdated and caught in a tradition. The SKS urgently needs a reform, but like so much else, it's stuck in Germany, somewhere in a swamp of sensitivities.

Alex has decided to go for the ASA. However, this is not happening at JoJo, but at a sailing school in Rijeka in the spring. We are curious to see if it's better. At least it seems more modern and flexible.
