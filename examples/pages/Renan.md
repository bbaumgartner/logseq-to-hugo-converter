- My dream is to embark on a journey across the globe in a camper, while my wife dreams of sailing around the world. So, let's delve into the world of sailing.

- We drove our beloved Mitsubishi Van from Europe to Mongolia and back, covering 20,000 kilometers—a journey we loved. However, time has caught up with us, and now we crave creature comforts: a comfortable bed, a shower, a toilet, a kitchen, a living room, air conditioning, heating, and high-speed internet. We've grown accustomed to these luxuries, and we don't want to give them up. Yes, we are old, and that’s fine. A camper, as much as we adore it, simply cannot provide all the amenities we now rely on. To satisfy our needs, we'd require a substantial vehicle—perhaps a truck or a bus weighing 10 to 20 tons. Some adventurers opt for such vehicles, despite the hefty fuel consumption and environmental impact.
- Alternatively, a sailing vessel weighing 10 to 20 tons—with a sail, of course—can effortlessly meet our requirements and allow us to navigate the world at no cost for fuel.
- All we need to do is learn sailing—a skill as old as human civilization itself. How difficult could it be? Enter Renan:

- Renan, captain of the sea, will be our skipper for a week in Ibiza. At 62, Renan commands a Comar Comet 12 from the 1980s. He has a lady friend in every port and likes partying hard—a detail that might become relevant later in this story.
- We meet Renan on Friday evening at Marina San Antoni in Ibiza. We start with rum, the best rum in the world, obviously. Renan is Cuban. The ship, though old and weathered by rough seas, appears to be in good and safe condition. Renan shows us how to operate the toilet, that’s our training.

- The first night, we stay in the marina and are annihilated by mosquitoes. The next day, we head out to Cala Benirrás, known for its hippie beach. Renan’s lady friend runs a yoga school there. We sail upwind—or rather, we use the engine. The waves make me seasick, and I struggle to keep from throwing up.

- In the evening, Bea joins us, and Renan cooks Cuban-style chicken and rice for us, claiming it's the best in the world. Bea explains that the hippies won't be playing their drums on the beach today. Even hippies need a day off to recover from their free-spirited lifestyle, I suppose.

- Renan takes Bea back ashore with the dingy and isn't seen again until 4 o'clock in the morning.
- Yesterday, I learned the importance of taking anti-seasickness medicine before the symptoms start. Today, we are able to sail, and it is truly relaxing: the boat sways peacefully in the wind, and the waves splash quietly against the hull. I could get used to this. Whatever pills Renan gave me, they are working wonders.
- We sail back to Platja des Jondal. The plan was to continue sailing around Ibiza, but the wind is not in our favor. Additionally, Renan’s Cuban friends are anchored at Platja des Jondal, which might be influencing our course.
- Once we anchor in Jondal, we need to go ashore because we've run out of essentials: beer and cigarettes. Renan shows me how to operate the dinghy and lets me drive. It’s terrifying and, due to the waves, not as easy as it looks.

- After dinner, Renan leaves us to play dominoes with his friends. Once again, he returns at dawn.
